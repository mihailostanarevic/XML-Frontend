# React-Redux Login Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is a simple template layout for login pages. It is using Ant Design as it's main UI library.

To run this project, run:
 
    >npm i
    >npm start

The project should be located at [localhost](http://localhost:3000/).

## Things of Note

- yarn is not currently included becuase there are currently issues with installing Ant Design (at least I'm having issues)
- have not added a signup/registration nor forgot password. That will be added in later
- feel free to fork and adjust to your needs/wants
